Macaulay2 language support in Atom
==================================

This package provides syntax highlighting for the Macaulay2 language for the Atom editor. It applies to files with the `m2` extension. It is also the reference grammar that [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) uses for highlighting Macaulay2 sources on Github.

The main repository for the Macaulay2 language is located at [https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2). Resources about the language can be found at [http://macaulay2.com](http://macaulay2.com/).

## Notes

This package is still in an early stage of development. Here is a [live demo] of the grammar using Lightshow.
